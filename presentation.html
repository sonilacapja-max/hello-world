    <H1>Welcome to our Network Presentation</H1>
    <p>This presentation covers the basics of networking, including protocols  and security measures.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A network is a system of connected elements, such as computers, devices, or people, that allows them to communicate and share information. 
        The term can refer to a computer network connecting devices to share hardware and data, or it can describe a group of people with shared interests or organizations that work together.

    <h3>Types of Networks</h3>
<h4>Local Area Networks (LANs) for small areas, <br>
    Wide Area Networks (WANs) that span large distances <br>
Global Area Networks (GANs) that cover large geographic areas 
</h4>
<h3>OSI layers model</h3>

<h3>Commands that we used this days</h3>
<p>ipconfig ip address= This command displays the current IP configuration of the device. <br> 
    nslookup name = This command queries the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping information. <br>
    ping = This command sends a message to a device and waits for a response to check connectivity e.g its like the game ping pong you ping the opponent and he pongs you. <br>
 ssh name@ ip address= This command connects with any server with a specified IP address.</p>
